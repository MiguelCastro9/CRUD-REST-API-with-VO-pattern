# Overview

A CRUD system with VO pattern, persistence, SpringBoot, REST API architecture and the main HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT and DELETE)

According to Wikipedia, a Value Object “is a small object that represents a simple entity whose equality is not based on identity: that is, two value objects are equal when they have the same value, not necessarily being the same object”.

This seems confusing when we think of Java objects acting as simple POJOs. Definitions aside, this pattern still undergoes changes in its explanations. Some define it in a way, others in their own way, etc. It is an object used primarily to display data in the presentation layer.
